# Project Omaha

A retro-styled arcade game portal experimenting with ways to tell the stories of open source through games.

## About

This project is an experiment in interactive storytelling — exploring how games can capture and share the culture, history, and personalities of open source communities. Each game is a small tribute to the people, projects, and culture that shape the open source world.

Fair warning: much of the code here is AI-generated slop. It's rough, experimental, and prioritizes "does it work?" over "is it elegant?" Consider yourself warned.

## Games

- **2347** — A 3D space shooter inspired by [XKCD #2347](https://xkcd.com/2347/). Defend critical open source infrastructure from threats!
- **Get Poul a Beer** — A 3D endless runner. Help Poul on his quest!
